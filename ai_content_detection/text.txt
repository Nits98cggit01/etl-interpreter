Education is one of the most important means of empowering women with the knowledge, skills, and self-confidence necessary to participate fully in the development process. Governments should establish mechanisms to accelerate womenâ€™s equal participation and equitable representation at all levels of the political process and public life in each community and society and enable women to articulate their concerns and needs and ensure the full and equal participation of women in decision-making processes in all spheres of life. Governments and civil society should take actions to eliminate attitudes and practices that discriminate against girls and women and gender inequality, will be able to complete a full course of primary schooling and that girls and boys will have equal access to all levels of education. Women are facing threats to their lives, health, and well-being as a result of being overburdened with work and of their lack of power and influence. In most regions of the world, women receive less formal education than men, and at the same time, abilities and coping mechanisms often go unrecognized. The power relations that women's attainment of healthy and fulfilling lives operate at many levels of society, from the most personal to the highly public. Achieving change requires policy and programme actions that will improve women's access to secure livelihoods and economic resources, alleviate their extreme responsibilities with regard to housework, remove legal to their participation in public life, and raise social awareness through effective programmes of education and mass communication.
